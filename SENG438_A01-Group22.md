# Introduction
In this lab, we are given the taks of testing an ATM application under both manual functional testing (MFT) principles and explortary testing principles. The application has two versions - the initial release and an updated release that incorpaorates chnages based on defects. This models an environment in which we can perform regression test. MFT involoves verifying a predetermined list of test cases to ensure that the basic requiremnets are functioning properly, In contrast, exploratory testing is an open-ended approach where the testers actively search for bugs and defects without following a rigid testing plan. The goal of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with software testing and gain a high-level understanding of different testing methods.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory testing plan consisted of two pairing testing groups. The first group tested as a typical ATM user. The second group tested as an ATM theief, where the inidviudal would take unconventional paths to try and exploit the machine. Each individual pair alternated between testing and note taking to discpover new perspective. 

Typical ATM User Test Plan:
For this plan, we mimicked a normal ATM user and tested both card #1 and card #2. A rough overview of the test plan was as such:
